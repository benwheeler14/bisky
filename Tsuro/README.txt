This project is an implementation of a the board game Tsuro (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxpQDmkdEQY), designed
specifically as an interface for a programmer to write AI agents to play the game.  The game package contains all the code for 
running games of Tsuro.  The player package contains the Player interface (classes that know how to play Tsuro),
and a collection of classes implementing it.  The view package contains the graphics for the game.  testing contains a number of
runnable java files for either: running a viewable game of Tsuro with various AI's playing, or running a series of games with 
different AI's playing to determine which AI's are the strongest.
